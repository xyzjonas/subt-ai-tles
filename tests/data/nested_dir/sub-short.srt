1
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Still in Yorkshire, eh, Jess?

2
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,120
Look at the wee'uns egg hunting.

3
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,800
Rather them than me.

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,280
Oh!

5
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,320
I'm so sorry.

6
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,560
Watch where you're going.

7
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm very sorry. I...

8
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,200
took my eye off for a second.

9
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,440
Oh, blast it.

10
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Put it on the list.
Sirop glicosilada.

11
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,080
Sirop...

12
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,920
It's so bloody hard to put things
back with the labels facing out!

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,800
Salammoniac, small.

14
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,960
Udder ointment, two tins.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,960
Percolate of mercury.
Wait. Can you spell that, please?

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Oh, and some more absorbent gauze.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,160
Six dozen rolls should do it.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,520
Absorbent gauze. Six...

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Would you mind?
I have an awful lot to get through.

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,160
What if I do mind?

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,400
KETTLE WHISTLES

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,600
You know that sound
means it's boiling, yes?

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
They are saying
we dropped more bombs

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,520
than all the German raids
on London in The Great War.

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,920
Well, sounds to me like
they don't need you after all.

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,120
I should withdraw my name,
if I were you. Very funny.

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,280
Where is Mrs Hall?
Out with Gerald maybe.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
PHONE RINGING

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,480
You're welcome.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,240
I suppose you want me to get that?

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,640
I never thought I'd admit this,

32
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,080
but we are missing Tristan.
