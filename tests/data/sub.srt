1
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,960
Still in Yorkshire, eh, Jess?

2
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,120
Look at the wee'uns egg hunting.

3
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,800
Rather them than me.

4
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,280
Oh!

5
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,320
I'm so sorry.

6
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,560
Watch where you're going.

7
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm very sorry. I...

8
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,200
took my eye off for a second.

9
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,440
Oh, blast it.

10
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,480
Put it on the list.
Sirop glicosilada.

11
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,080
Sirop...

12
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,920
It's so bloody hard to put things
back with the labels facing out!

13
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,800
Salammoniac, small.

14
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,960
Udder ointment, two tins.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,960
Percolate of mercury.
Wait. Can you spell that, please?

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,680
Oh, and some more absorbent gauze.

17
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,160
Six dozen rolls should do it.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,520
Absorbent gauze. Six...

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Would you mind?
I have an awful lot to get through.

20
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,160
What if I do mind?

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,400
KETTLE WHISTLES

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,600
You know that sound
means it's boiling, yes?

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
They are saying
we dropped more bombs

24
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,520
than all the German raids
on London in The Great War.

25
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,920
Well, sounds to me like
they don't need you after all.

26
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,120
I should withdraw my name,
if I were you. Very funny.

27
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,280
Where is Mrs Hall?
Out with Gerald maybe.

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,640
PHONE RINGING

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,480
You're welcome.

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,240
I suppose you want me to get that?

31
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,640
I never thought I'd admit this,

32
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,080
but we are missing Tristan.

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,080
I wish he would just admit it.

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,400
Between giving up his pipe
and missing Tris,

35
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,680
he's really found a new level.

36
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,400
At least the smoking
is just for Lent.

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,040
That was Slavens.

38
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,080
Another difficult lambing, he said,
that's the second one this month.

39
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,840
Poor man.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,600
He must be really struggling.

41
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,280
But he's an experienced farmer,

42
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,480
he's perfectly capable
of sorting it out himself.

43
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,560
Oh, it must be your sparkling
company he enjoys, Siegfried.

44
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,080
Oscar Wilde considered sarcasm
the lowest form of wit.

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,560
But the highest form
of intelligence.

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,280
I'll see you later.

47
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,120
I know he can be...

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,720
testing.

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,200
Testing?

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,880
The longest 40 days of my life.

51
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,880
He keeps rabbiting on
about self-control.

52
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,320
If he was so great at it,

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,200
why has he asked Audrey
to hide his tobacco?

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,800
He was looking
in the airing cupboard.

55
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,440
He keeps lecturing about how
I should renounce my indulgences.

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,560
What did you say?

57
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,480
Whisky was the only thing
stopping me from murdering him.

58
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,480
HUMS SIMPLE TUNE

59
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,480
Get out of the way, sheep!

60
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,000
Thank you.

61
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,400
Mr Slavens.

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,200
Mr Farnon.
Good morning.

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,880
Kind of you to come so quickly.

64
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,800
There's not a flake of snow
in Darrowby.

65
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,760
Aye, it's like
the North Pole up here.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,040
You get three seasons in one day.

67
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,080
Is that Hurley's Cut?
It is.

68
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,480
Are you partial to it an' all?
No, it's a filthy habit.

69
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,280
Where's the patient?
She's through here.

70
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,520
CHILDREN CLAMOURING

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,400
Good morning.

72
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,240
Oh, James,
look at their little faces.

73
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,720
Is that broodiness I detect?

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,200
Mm.

75
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,920
Say that again, "broodiness".

76
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,520
SCOTTISH TWANG: Broodiness.

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,320
Don't you wish
there wasn't a war on?

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,320
I'd better get started.

79
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,080
Those ducks won't race themselves.

80
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,400
Right, then, are we ready?

81
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,840
CHEERING

82
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,400
The first duck
under that bridge wins. Right?

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Yeah!
One...

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,520
two, three!

85
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,640
Quack!

86
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,560
CHEERING

87
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,400
Oi! Stop that!

88
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,440
Well done, you can do it.

89
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,000
Oi! I want a word with you.

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,400
CHEERING

91
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
It's a capital job, Mr Farnon.

92
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
Yes.

93
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,800
I'm surprised you needed me,
it was straightforward enough.

94
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,560
Aye, but it's a job for small mitts.

95
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,120
Yours are smaller than mine.

96
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,280
Our Elsie were a breach.

97
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,120
Took some pushing and pulling
to get her out, I can tell thee.

98
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,440
HE LAUGHS

99
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,360
Oh, look, he's perking up now.

100
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,960
Do you mind putting that out?
Can't be any good for the lamb.

101
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,960
EWE BLEATING

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,040
Oh, heck,
I hope she hasn't rejected it.

103
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,760
Poor little bugger.

104
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,600
Probably blames it
for causing her all that pain.

105
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,240
I hope not.

106
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm sure she'll come round.

107
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,840
Stay for a brew?

108
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,360
No, I should get on.

109
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,400
Just...

110
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,400
call me
if there's any other trouble.

111
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,000
Right. Will do.

112
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,560
Thanks again.

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
Hey, hey.

114
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,480
DOG YELPS

115
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,960
DOG WHINES

116
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
Hello there.

117
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,920
All right, little one.

118
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm not going to hurt you.

119
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,400
There we go.

120
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,560
Let's have a wee look at you,
shall we?

121
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,880
You poorly little fellow.

122
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
Argh.

123
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,120
Stay away from him!

124
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,000
Stay away from my dog!

125
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,160
Next.

126
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,000
I'd like to...

127
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,400
Well, I'm here about the...

128
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,120
Speak up. I can't hear you.

129
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm looking to get a divorce.

130
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,760
On what grounds?

131
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
Er...

132
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,760
I dunno what you'd call it.

133
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,760
We've been apart for years.

134
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
Desertion.

135
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Well, I wouldn't, how that sounds.

136
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,120
Have you had any contact with your
husband in the past three years?

137
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,000
Hmm.

138
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,440
You will need to fill these in.

139
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,320
Now?

140
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,040
We require a detailed statement
documenting the disintegration

141
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,760
of your marriage,
together with any...

142
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,320
A statement?

143
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,560
Together with
any relevant correspondence,

144
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,480
photographs and documents. Yes.

145
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,040
Can't I just...

146
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,720
The thing is, I haven't seen him...

147
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,160
in so long,

148
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,880
I thought I could

149
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,440
just...

150
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,000
Well,

151
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,040
you thought wrong.

152
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,480
Next.

153
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,160
How come
I've not seen him around before?

154
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,400
He used to go to school with Jenny
when they were little.

155
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,200
They booted him out.
What for?

156
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,960
Showing off, I think.

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,680
Binks, Wesley Binks.

158
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,080
You all right in there, Siegfried?

159
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,800
Yes, I was just
looking for something.

160
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,080
Not your tobacco by any chance?
No, of course not.

161
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,480
Oh.

162
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,880
If you ask me, he's trouble.

163
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,560
He should be in Borstal.

164
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,240
Maybe you should give him a break.

165
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Some folk are just
dealt a bad hand in life.

166
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,600
Maybe so, but people like him
shouldn't be allowed pets.

167
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,200
Who shouldn't be allowed pets?

168
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,520
James got thumped
by a boy at the duck race.

169
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,040
It's not how it sounds
and he wasn't a boy for a start,

170
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,720
he was a young man.
Hmm?

171
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,560
A very young man.

172
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,640
And now he's started a campaign
to bring back public hanging.

173
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,160
You should have seen
the look he gave me.

174
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,440
I think he wanted to disembowel me
with a rusty fork.

175
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,920
Do you know him, Audrey?
Wesley Binks?

176
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
Audrey?

177
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,080
Is everything all right?
You don't seem yourself.

178
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,840
Quite all right, thank you... Helen.

179
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,800
People like that
are born troublemakers.

180
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,000
There's nothing
anyone can do to change them.

181
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,680
You don't believe that. Here.

182
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,240
A wild dog will bite, you know.

183
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,520
Just as a spider
knows to make a web,

184
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,280
or a bird a nest,
it's in their nature.

185
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,440
Well, how's it you can break
a wild horse, then?

186
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,440
Did you order those supplies?

187
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,600
When I say I'll do something,
Siegfried,

188
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,080
I do it.

189
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,360
Noted.

190
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,080
MRS HALL SIGHS

191
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,960
Stay strong.

192
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,800
We are on the home straight.

193
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,680
Here you are.

194
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,280
Do you know where he lives,
this Binks?

195
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,400
Old Mill Terrace.

196
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Just past the Robinsons' farm,
last I heard.

197
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,600
James, don't do anything daft.

198
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,640
It's not about the boy,
it's the dog.

199
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,360
Why, do you think
he's mistreating it?

200
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,880
Maybe worse than that.

201
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,680
I think he has distemper.

202
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,120
Oh, that's bad, isn't it?

203
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,800
Unless you catch it early enough...

204
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,440
it's a death sentence.

205
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,920
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

206
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,600
DOG WHINES

207
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,280
Shh.

208
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,000
Are the others out?

209
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,080
Didn't hear you coming.
Oh.

210
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,320
No.

211
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,920
Give that to me.

212
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,880
You're getting divorced?

213
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,160
That's a good shot of Edward.

214
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,960
Isn't it?

215
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,840
I'm worried about him.

216
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,280
It's no bloody use
shut away in a tin.

217
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,920
Put it up somewhere you can see it.

218
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
You sure you don't mind?

219
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,040
Course not.

220
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,080
Be nice to have one of Tris
up somewhere, too.

221
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,840
If such a thing exists.

222
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,440
His fondness for gurning
like a chimpanzee in every picture

223
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,080
makes it something of a challenge.

224
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,400
Excuse me?

225
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm looking
for Wesley Binks's house.

226
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
Aye, just round the corner.
Second door.

227
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
Thank you.

228
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,240
Keep away from my washing.

229
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,080
Go on. Cheeky beggars.

230
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,800
I'll give you that.

231
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,680
Come on.
I've not got time for you today.

232
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,840
KNOCKING

233
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,680
Hello. Wait, I'm a vet.

234
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,760
Your dog has distemper.
What's that?

235
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,840
It's a serious disease. He must
have caught it from another dog.

236
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,280
I don't know what you're on about.
Look, I just...

237
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,960
Can I take a proper look at him?

238
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,560
Please, can I come in?

239
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,640
Piss off!

240
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,600
Did you not hear me?

241
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm not going anywhere
until I see your dog, Wesley.

242
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,000
He needs help.

243
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,080
My name is James.

244
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,880
James Herriot.

245
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
DOG WHINES

246
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,960
You ain't half as good
as you think you are.

247
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,640
That's a pity.

248
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,160
I had dreams
of playing for Scotland.

249
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,080
Is anyone at home?

250
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,280
Are you done with that?

251
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,960
The pork pie? Go ahead.

252
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,280
What's his name?

253
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,720
Duke.
And how old is he?

254
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,880
What's with all the questions?

255
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,840
The more I know about him, the
better chance I have of helping him.

256
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,960
How do you know he's got
whatever it's called?

257
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,240
You see how he's flinching
in the light?

258
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,680
It's called photophobia.

259
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,120
It's one of the signs.

260
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,920
And you must have noticed
the pus in his eyes.

261
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,600
Don't know what you're on about.

262
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,680
For most dogs with distemper,
the outlook is pretty bleak.

263
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,320
Look, I just want to help him,
Wesley.

264
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,640
I've had an idea, but you have
to want to help him, too.

265
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,400
What he needs most is treatment

266
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,560
and if he's somewhere
where he can be properly fed...

267
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,120
Who do you think you are?

268
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,200
Telling me how to treat my own dog?

269
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,000
You're talking shite.

270
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,640
Where the bloody hell
has she hidden it?

271
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,440
Siegfried.

272
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,880
What do you do
when an animal is suffering,

273
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,560
but the owner
won't let you treat it?

274
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,160
I take it, this is Wesley Binks,
we are talking about.

275
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,440
His dog has distemper.

276
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,840
Ah, not much hope for him, then.

277
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,960
Maybe not,
but I have to try something.

278
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,800
A mixed mat is your best bet.

279
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,640
Yes, I know that, but, like I said,
it's Wesley that's the problem.

280
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,720
If he doesn't want your help,
you have to accept it.

281
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,600
It's the owners that employ us,
not the animals.

282
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
But I can't just stand back
and do nothing.

283
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,760
It seems to me
that you've done everything you can.

284
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,360
When I was younger,
an early night was a punishment.

285
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,080
Now it's a treat.

286
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,200
You're still thinking about
that dog, aren't you?

287
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,920
I think I'm going
to report it to the RSPCA.

288
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,200
Are you sure, James?
That's a big decision.

289
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,200
I know, but I have a duty
to make sure

290
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,480
it doesn't spread to any other dogs.

291
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
No matter
what you think of that boy,

292
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,000
does he really deserve
to lose his dog?

293
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,360
Cos that's what will happen.

294
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,560
Then he should have
taken better care of him.

295
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,480
I've got to put the animal first.

296
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,760
I really hope you're right.

297
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,040
I don't see that I have any choice.

298
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,960
Come on.

299
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,040
Very good.

300
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,280
Uh-huh.

301
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,200
All right,
I'll meet you outside the property.

302
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,000
Thanks. Bye.

303
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,040
He agreed
it's an animal welfare emergency.

304
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,360
I'm to meet them
outside Wesley's place in an hour.

305
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,520
At least that poor dog
will stand a chance now.

306
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,800
Cut it out.
Come on, Jess, come on.

307
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,960
Come on.
Is it tomorrow, Siegfried?

308
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,960
Or Easter Sunday?
What?

309
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,760
When Lent is officially over.
You must be counting down the hours.

310
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,600
You seem to think
this is a challenge for me.

311
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,080
It's simply a question of tenacity,

312
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,160
when one commits to something,
one sees it through.

313
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,920
It's not forever, though.

314
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,600
Well, it could be.

315
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,760
I could easily be a non-smoker,
if I chose to be.

316
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,720
Mr Slavens is on the phone.

317
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,280
Says his ewe has rejected its lamb.

318
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,640
Right.

319
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,240
KNOCKING

320
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,320
I'd just started.

321
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,120
Get down.

322
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,920
No.

323
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,000
Delivery for Farnon.

324
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,640
Are you sure?

325
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,280
What on earth is it?

326
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,160
Sterile dressings, it says here.

327
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,360
I ordered six dozen rolls.

328
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,320
No, you ordered six dozen boxes.

329
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,200
There's six boxes each one.

330
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,440
Wait, wait.

331
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,920
Can we send 'em back?

332
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,640
You have to speak to an office.
They are closed till Tuesday.

333
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,320
Happy Easter.

334
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,440
I'll tell Siegfried
that I made a mistake,

335
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,000
how bad can it be?

336
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,800
Yeah, you're right.

337
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,640
What can we do?

338
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,960
Best stick it in the pantry.
I'll get James.

339
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,080
Ooh.

340
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,480
That the last of them?

341
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,640
James!

342
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
Ah.

343
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,360
Here. Here.

344
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,320
He's coming, he's coming.

345
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,640
He's coming. Quick!

346
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,200
Quick, quick, quick, get in.

347
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,160
Where's James?

348
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,360
Erm, he's upstairs, I think.

349
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,120
CLATTERING
Oh, bugger.

350
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,480
Were you just going
to leave me in there?

351
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,560
The things I do for you.

352
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,960
THEY LAUGH

353
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,760
She won't let him near her,
Mr Farnon.

354
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,160
Has he had any milk at all?

355
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,320
I gave him a bottle last night,
but it's colostrum he needs.

356
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,080
Let's have a look.

357
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,640
LAMB BLEATS

358
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,360
Mouth seems fine.
EWE BLEATING

359
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,480
All right, old girl,
not gonna hurt you.

360
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,360
No sores.

361
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
No mastitis, as far as I can see.

362
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,360
Have you used a bonding pen before?

363
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,480
A few of these should do the trick.

364
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,440
Right.

365
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,240
Now, see if we can't give you
a helping hand, eh?

366
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,920
Mrs Binks.
Aye.

367
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,040
My name is Herriot, I'm a vet,
and this lady's from the RSPCA.

368
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,800
We are looking for Wesley.

369
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,920
Oh, he's out wi' dog.
You'll find him on tops.

370
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,520
Well, actually, do you mind
if we speak to you?

371
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,960
Sit yourself down.

372
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,520
Thank you.

373
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,920
MRS BINKS GROANS

374
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,880
So, you must be
Wesley's grandmother?

375
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,720
Great-grandmother.

376
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,520
Er, no veterinary around here.

377
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,240
What's this about?

378
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
It's about Duke, Mrs Binks.

379
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,200
Given his health
and general condition,

380
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,320
we feel he would be better off
in someone else's care.

381
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,480
Honest to God,
I wish he'd never got that dog.

382
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,640
Last thing we need
is another mouth to feed.

383
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,080
There's no shame in it.
When times are tough like these,

384
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
pets are often
the first to go without.

385
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,800
Ha, you try telling that to Wes.

386
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
Puts that dog before hisself.

387
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,120
He's been giving his food to Duke?

388
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,640
Worships that dog, he does.

389
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,840
I can't tell you the rows we've had.

390
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,840
And is this where the dog sleeps?

391
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,960
Aye.

392
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,240
Would you excuse us, Mrs Binks?

393
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,840
Ee, that dog.

394
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,680
Clearly I was wrong.

395
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,000
Duke has plenty of food.
His bed is pristine.

396
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,320
He is well looked after.
I'm sorry for wasting your time,

397
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,480
but you're obviously
not needed here after all.

398
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,680
Mr Herriot...
Oi!

399
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,240
What's going on? Nothing
to worry about. I can explain. Wes!

400
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,280
It's obvious to me, Mr Herriot,
that the animal is poorly

401
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,040
and in a situation
that poses a risk to its life.

402
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,160
You know as well as I do the animal
would be better off in our care.

403
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,120
But he's doing his best for him.

404
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,760
Please, look, I'm prepared
to take full responsibility,

405
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,920
I'll make sure Duke gets
all the necessary care,

406
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,520
if that's what you need to hear.

407
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,000
Right,

408
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,640
well, next time, make sure
you do a proper assessment

409
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,160
of the situation before calling us.
Thank you. Thank you.

410
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,960
Wes!

411
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,520
Wes, I can see you
hiding behind there.

412
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,760
I'm so sorry.

413
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,200
If you come
anywhere near me and my dog again,

414
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,560
you'll be sorry.

415
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,840
Wes, if you don't let me help him,
he is going to die.

416
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,400
How are your daughters, Mr Slavens?

417
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,160
You have two girls, as I recall.

418
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,400
Both well. Thanks for asking.

419
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,080
Lily turns 21 this year.

420
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,080
They grow up fast, don't they?

421
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,680
Now, the trick is
to hold her head up high,

422
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,200
with your hand on...

423
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,320
..the halter like this.

424
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,400
Right, put the lamb down.

425
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,400
Yes, you'll need to hold her legs.

426
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,160
BLEATING

427
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,160
Oh. Ah.

428
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,440
There we go.

429
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,400
You'll have to repeat this
every four to six hours,

430
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,920
until the ewe and lamb are bonded.
I can't do this on my own.

431
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,520
No, you need a helping hand.

432
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,560
My farm hands have gone off
to fight. Both of 'em.

433
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,520
I'm sure
one of your daughters could help.

434
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,680
Or Mrs Slavens.
She's strong as an ox, I recall.

435
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,960
Aye, that she is.

436
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,520
How long does it usually take?

437
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,200
The bonding? A few days.

438
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,120
You can always give me another call
if there's any trouble. Aye.

439
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,920
Thank you, Mr Farnon.

440
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,400
If you scrub that any harder,
you will dislocate something.

441
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,520
You were right about Wesley.

442
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,560
What happened?

443
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,480
I should never have assumed
he was mistreating his dog.

444
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,440
Now he hates me and I've probably
just condemned Duke to death.

445
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,600
Well, you put the animal first.

446
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,800
But I let Wesley down.

447
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,200
Ah. Helen.

448
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,080
What is this?

449
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,840
And why is it in here?

450
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
What are you doing
in the linen cupboard?

451
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,080
You can't answer a question
with another question.

452
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,840
Why can't I?
You just did it again.

453
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,920
I'm sure Audrey has her reasons.

454
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,280
Wait.

455
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,160
Er...

456
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,160
Do you happen to know
if Mr and Mrs Slavens

457
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,680
have been having
difficulties of some sort?

458
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,480
What?

459
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,480
Valerie Slavens died last month.

460
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,320
Surely you knew that?

461
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,000
Oh, God.

462
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,960
Poor man has barely got over
his daughters flying the nest.

463
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
Now he's all on his own.

464
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,520
Hey.

465
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,840
It's all right, man.

466
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,480
You have to help him, mister.

467
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,520
You've done the right thing, Wesley.

468
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,080
I know it wasn't easy.

469
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,200
I knew he weren't right.

470
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,680
Just...

471
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,240
thought he might get better.

472
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,280
This is something
called hyperimmune serum.

473
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,840
Helps the body fight the infection.

474
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,480
Good lad.

475
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,360
I've had him since he were a pup.

476
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,440
He's my best pal in t'world.

477
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,480
I'll do everything I can.

478
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,280
I promise you.

479
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,720
I don't want him to die.

480
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,160
There's one thing working
in Duke's favour.

481
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,040
He's not a purebred.

482
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,800
You see, crossbred dogs

483
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,920
they have this thing
called hybrid vigour,

484
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,560
which helps them to fight disease,

485
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,760
and with a bit of luck,
we've caught it early enough.

486
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,440
I know it ain't enough.

487
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,080
Don't worry. There's no charge.

488
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,600
No, I don't want charity.

489
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,400
That's not charity, it's...

490
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,000
No, thank you.

491
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,720
Must be...

492
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,280
some way I can pay.

493
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,160
Wesley Binks is going to be doing
some work for us, Siegfried.

494
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,920
The boy who attacked you?

495
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,560
He's not a bad lad.

496
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,320
He's going to help us out mucking
out the animal shed for a few days.

497
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,960
Have you completely lost your mind?

498
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,720
I think it's a good idea.

499
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,360
He'll be fine, Siegfried.

500
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,640
I trust him.

501
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
Jess, Tash, come on.

502
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,160
Oh, here you are.

503
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,720
I'm...

504
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,240
I were thinking of putting
another parcel together for Tris,

505
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,040
if you wanted to write him a letter.

506
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,520
There's nothing
really new to report.

507
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,760
I don't think I can do it.

508
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,600
I made my vows before God.

509
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,760
On Sunday, I'll be in church,

510
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,560
on the holiest day of the year.

511
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,280
With Gerald beside me.

512
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,920
I'm not sure I'd considered his
intentions towards you before now.

513
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,480
Gerald?

514
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,840
Oh, no, it's not that.

515
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,680
I have no intention of leaving,
Mr Farnon.

516
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,600
That's not what I meant.

517
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,120
Will there be anything else?

518
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,240
Mr Farnon.

519
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,040
Kind of you to drop in.

520
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,320
I was just passing.

521
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,080
Not nearly so mardy today.

522
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,920
Your trick seems to be working.

523
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,760
Mr Slavens,
when I was here yesterday...

524
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,840
I'm afraid,
I didn't know about your wife.

525
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,960
I'm so sorry.

526
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,400
I had no idea you were...

527
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,280
up here by yourself.

528
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,440
One minute
the house is full of folk,

529
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,840
and laughter...

530
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,800
Next, it's empty.

531
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,120
It can't be easy
with your daughters gone, too.

532
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,800
It's daft.

533
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,440
You think they'll be around forever.

534
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,320
You... You don't expect them to...

535
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,280
..not need you any more.

536
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,520
Still, you have to let them
find their own way, don't you?

537
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
They'll be back, when they need me.

538
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,120
Good lad, that should do it.

539
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,440
"Ho... u...

540
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,000
"dini."

541
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,240
It's Houdini. The great Houdini.

542
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,960
So, is he always escaping, then?

543
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,200
Take your eye off him for a second
and... he's gone.

544
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,800
James.
Siegfried.

545
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,080
This is Wesley.

546
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,960
Yes, I've heard all about
Wesley Binks.

547
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,600
Mr Herriot seems to think
you're doing well.

548
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,440
Let's see, shall we?

549
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,560
Why don't you leave this to me,
Siegfried?

550
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,200
Have you changed their water?

551
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,720
Yes, sir.

552
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,720
And they've all been fed
and their cages cleaned.

553
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,160
MEOWING

554
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,360
Hmm.

555
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,640
Who takes 'em out?

556
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,760
Sorry?

557
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,680
Well, they can't stay cooped up
in this cage all day,

558
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,800
it ain't right.

559
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
They are only here
until they are well enough

560
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,160
to return to their own home.

561
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,720
Well, they still need a run around.

562
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,680
I'll let you discuss this
with Mr Herriot.

563
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,800
I owe you an apology, Mrs Hall...

564
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,680
for the way
I spoke to you last night.

565
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,880
I'm also aware
that I've not been at my most...

566
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,240
patient or good-natured
these past few weeks.

567
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,680
Anyway, last night I...

568
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,280
These are personal matters,
none of my business.

569
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,560
Of course you must seek a divorce.

570
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,600
They want a statement.

571
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,280
A detailed account
of my entire marriage.

572
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,280
And I just...

573
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,600
Yes, it must be hard to...
dredge all that stuff up.

574
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,880
Well, it's between Robert and me,
no-one else.

575
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,400
Sometimes we have to look
that monster right in the face.

576
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,520
Show we're not afraid of it
any more.

577
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,440
Well, it's not that I don't want to.

578
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,000
Because I do.

579
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,440
Desperately.

580
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,000
Why don't you use my study?

581
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,200
I promise you, once it's done,
you'll feel like a new woman.

582
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,280
I can see to it
that you're not disturbed.

583
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,040
GENTLE KNOCKING

584
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,160
JAUNTY TUNE

585
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,720
PIANO OFF KEY

586
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,880
Hmm.

587
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,600
I wonder.

588
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,520
Ha-ha-ha.

589
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,680
Helen?

590
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Siegfried?
In here.

591
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,240
This way.

592
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,520
Thank you.

593
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,000
I made a mistake with the order.

594
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,600
A mistake?

595
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,760
We've enough gauze
to see out the decade.

596
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,480
I'm sorry.

597
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,080
Where's my tobacco?

598
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,920
Siegfried, I meant to say...

599
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,080
if you have any other jobs
you'd like Wesley to do,

600
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,680
just let me know.

601
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,960
Aha!

602
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,880
I thought you'd given up.

603
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,960
Well, nobody is perfect.

604
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,760
I don't know if it's the structure
or the responsibility,

605
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,680
but Wes is taking to work
like a duck to water.

606
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,680
I was wondering if we might find him
something more regular?

607
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,560
I think
we might do better than that.

608
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,360
Come on.

609
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,560
Duke! Come on, Duke.

610
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,640
Good boy.

611
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,560
Duke.

612
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,320
Yeah, good boy.

613
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,240
Good boy.

614
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,080
I can see why you like it up here.

615
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,040
Mr Herriot.

616
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,200
Hello, boy.

617
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,960
He is looking much better.

618
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,240
I've been cleaning his nose,
just like you told me.

619
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,480
Yeah, but it's more done that,
his eyes are brighter.

620
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,320
He's been eating like a horse.

621
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,880
That's good to hear.

622
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,120
Hey.

623
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,040
Do you... think he might make it,
then?

624
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,720
It's too early to say for sure,
but these are good signs.

625
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,840
Did you hear that? Good one.

626
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,600
He's a lucky dog.

627
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,080
But I don't think
he could wish for a better owner.

628
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,680
Listen,

629
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,480
Mr Farnon had an idea,

630
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,080
which I wanted to talk to you about.

631
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,080
How is Duke with snow?
He loves it.

632
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,680
That's good.

633
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,320
Why is that?

634
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,840
You'll see soon enough.

635
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,800
You're all right, mister.

636
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,960
Go ahead.

637
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,880
Hello, mister.

638
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,400
I'm Clifton.

639
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,520
Wesley.

640
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,640
What's your dog called?
Duke.

641
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,320
# Let the merry cymbal sound

642
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,000
# Fill the pipe
With greatest pleasure

643
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,720
# Pom porom porom pom pom. #

644
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,680
At least you made it to Easter.

645
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,480
I'll give up some day.

646
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,200
I'm glad you're going to church.

647
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,760
Nobody will judge you, Mrs Hall.

648
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,440
And if they do, so bloody what?

649
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,760
I wanted to thank you.

650
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,880
For your help yesterday.

651
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,400
I didn't do anything.

652
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,120
I disagree.

653
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,880
You were right.

654
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,920
It was something
that I needed to do.

655
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,280
He looks so proud.

656
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,760
Rightly so.

657
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,240
Not a hint of chimpanzee.

658
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,680
Writing it all down
sometimes helps, you know.

659
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,560
A wise man taught me that.

660
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,360
Gerald.

661
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,520
Morning, Audrey.

662
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,560
Ah, Mr Farnon.

663
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,120
Morning. Happy Easter.

664
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,600
Happy Easter.

665
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,160
Well...

666
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,640
Enjoy the service.
You not coming?

667
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,560
I think I'll give this one a miss.

668
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,200
I have a letter to write.

669
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,600
BLEATING

670
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,560
He'll be all right.
